""" Lab 10: Save people
You can save people from heart disease by training a model to predict whether a person has heart disease or not.
The dataset is available at src/lab10/heart.csv
Train a model to predict whether a person has heart disease or not and test its performance.
You can usually improve the model by normalizing the input data. Try that and see if it improves the performance.
