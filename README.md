# Repository for Labs
## CMPSC 441 and GAME 450

This repository will contain code for all the lab sessions for the course. New folders will be added to 'src' folder with the name of the lab. 

## Abstract

This report presents an in-depth exploration of 14 lab assignments culminating in a final project that encompasses multiple methods and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Each lab delves into a different area of AI, spanning basic concepts to more advanced methods that can be used for procedural generation and language models, aiming to equip participants with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills. The report systematically outlines the ai components utilized in the final project built from each lab and how it helped build the experience. In my own personal experience, I've only ever partially worked with Python, but overall I am happy and think I've progressed my understanding of both python and the ai components discussed in the course material via the labs and final project structure. There are still bugs in my project that I didn't figure out in time, which I think are mostly related to my lack of knowledge with Python, but regardless I'm still proud of the progress.

## AI Components Involved
1. Genetic Algorithms
    - Problems Solved
        - Creates a more realistic city map for the player to explore and prevents the overlapping of cities
    - Inputs
        - None
    - Outputs
        - Landscape, city, and route map
2. AI Opponents
    - Problems Solved
        - Gives the player a varying and challenging opponent for combat events, while preventing a player from getting used to the same mechanic over and over again.
    - Inputs
        - None
    - Outputs
        - Can change the state/status of the player
3. AI prompts for 'battle logs'
    - Problems Solved
        - Makes the player feel more real and immersive
    - Inputs
        - Chooses a random prompt out of a list of 5 as it's context
    - Outputs
        - AI generated text to represent the player's thought after a battle
